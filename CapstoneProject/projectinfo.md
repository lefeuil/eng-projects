Capstone Project -- full year team-based course to complete an engineering project, from ideation to realisation. 

Our chosen task was to design and build a prototype mobile robot for security and surveillance, complete with an android-based mobile user interface with broadcasted video feed. 
The robot was built using a Raspberry-Pi 5, mechanum wheels, and a custom-printed chassis. The UI app was developed in Android Studio.
